This dataset consists of images collected from the open-source API provided by Singapore's Land Transport Authority (LTA). The images are categorized into five traffic density levels: Empty, Low, Medium, High, and Traffic Jam. Out of 87 available traffic cameras, 20 were selected based on their ability to capture diverse and relevant images. Selection criteria included variability in traffic density, different lighting conditions, clear visibility (without obstructions), and suitable camera angles. A total of 4,054 images were manually labeled and then randomly divided into subsets: 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing. To enhance robustness, the dataset includes images captured during both daytime and nighttime.
